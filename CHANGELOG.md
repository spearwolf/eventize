# CHANGELOG

## `v3.4.2` (2024-06-01)

- extend the signature of `.onceAsync()` so that the type of the promise return value can be specified optionally
- ugprade build package dependencies
- upgrade the javascript target version to ES2022 (was ES2021)

## `v3.4.1`

- retained events always maintain their original order in which they were published!
- the methods `.retain()` and `.retainClear()` now also optionally allow the specification of multiple events

## `v3.4.0`

- fix `.once()` behavior with multiple event names
- fix `.onceAsync()`

## `v3.3.0`

- with `.onceAsync()` only the event names are accepted as parameters, no callback functions anymore (this makes no sense)
- introduce the `.retainClear()` method: clear a saved event

## `v3.2.0`

- introduce `.onceAsync()`

## `v3.1.2`

- The `src/` folder no longer ends up in the npm package by mistake!

## `v3.1.1`

- `eventize()` can now create a `{}` by itself if no custom object is given

## `v3.1.0`

- introduce `.emitAsync()`

## `v3.0.2`

- Fix exported type definitions
- Clean up the build system internally (using `tsup`)

## `v3.0.1`

- Mark npm package as side effects free

## `v3.0.0`

### Npm Package

- Under the hood, the build pipeline has been modernised and now uses Typescript v5.2 internally.
- The javascript fragment output of the npm package `@spearwolf/eventize` has been fixed:
  - there is no _default_ export anymore. instead of the default export, the named export `eventize` should now be used.
- a CHANGELOG was finally introduced 😉

### Migration Guide

- Change all _default_ imports to the explicit named import: `import {eventize} from '@spearwolf/eventize'`
