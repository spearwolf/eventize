# CHANGELOG

## `v3.1.1`

- `eventize()` can now create a `{}` by itself if no custom object is given

## `v3.1.0`

- introduce `.emitAsync()`

## `v3.0.2`

- Fix exported type definitions
- Clean up the build system internally (using `tsup`)

## `v3.0.1`

- Mark npm package as side effects free

## `v3.0.0`

### Npm Package

- Under the hood, the build pipeline has been modernised and now uses Typescript v5.2 internally.
- The javascript fragment output of the npm package `@spearwolf/eventize` has been fixed:
  - there is no _default_ export anymore. instead of the default export, the named export `eventize` should now be used.
- a CHANGELOG was finally introduced 😉

### Migration Guide

- Change all _default_ imports to the explicit named import: `import {eventize} from '@spearwolf/eventize'`
